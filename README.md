# OrienationDroneProject

This project will work to take pictures and videos of the UCF campus using the DJI Tello.
This will be done by using a combination of gesture control and GPS in python.

## Get Started
The DJI Tello drone is a great drone to use for coding projects. It can be used for a variety of tasks. After purchasing a DJI Tello, follow these steps in order to pilot it using python.

The steps to piloting the drone using the computer.
1. Install python
2. Get an IDE, VS Code is preferred
3. Open the command prompt and enter "pip3 install djitellopy" (this will install the python libraries)
4. Connect your computer to the DJI Tello using wifi
5. Run your code! (Look at the "Takeoff" for the basic takeoff code)
